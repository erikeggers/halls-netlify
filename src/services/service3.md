title: "Tree Shaping"
desc: "Shaping the crown of a tree can help it retain its visual balance which can become a wonderful accent to your home. We can also cut the lower limbs back making the tree appear taller and leaner. This helps eliminate any limbs that may be blocking the visibility of things low to the ground for example the entrance to your home."
